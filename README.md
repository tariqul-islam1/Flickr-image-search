# Flickr Image Search - Android
Retrofit is awesome. FastAdapter is awesome too. Let's make an image search app using free Flickr API.

FastAdapter is one of my favourite GitHub projects but I found very few tutorials about it. It made my work far simpler and faster. You may also consider a try. Trust me, it's easy and fun!
