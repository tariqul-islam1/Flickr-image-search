# Retrofit-FastAdapter
Retrofit is awesome. FastAdapter is awesome too. Let's do both at the same time lazy talents ;)

I created this especially for FastAdapter. FastAdapter is one of my favourite GitHub projects but I found very few tutorials about it. It made my work far simpler and faster. You may also consider a try. Trust me, it's easy and fun!
